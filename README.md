# nuxt library demo

this repo is demonstrates how you can build your own library to use for nuxt. (it's a monorepo with a nuxt app and nuxt library in it)

I'm using:
* webpack to build a library that can be rendered on server and on client
* extract css
* tailwind to demonstrate how you can extend your library

## get started
to install needed dependencies
* npm install
* npm run bootstrap

### build library
npm run build-lib

### start nuxt dev server
npm run dev
